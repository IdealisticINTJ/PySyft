Welcome to the SyftBox User Server: The Magical User Registry with Unbreakable Seals! üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüìúüîê

Toy Box Story:
Imagine a magical scroll that keeps track of all the toy owners in the kingdom.
Each owner must provide a unique magical seal (public key) when they register.
Once registered, their seal can never be changed!

Reality:
This is a Flask server that maintains a list of users with their associated public keys.
It allows adding new users with their public keys and retrieving the list of all users.

Congratulations! You've set up the magical user registry with unbreakable seals. üéâ

This server will keep track of all the toy owners (users) in our SyftBox kingdom,
along with their unique magical seals (public keys). Once a seal is set, it can never be changed!

Next, let's create a client plugin that will use this magical scroll to create
toy boxes (folders) for each owner and manage their magical seals!
