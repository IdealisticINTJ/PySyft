Welcome to the SyftBox Configuration Plugin: The Toy Box Setup Wizard! üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüì¶

Toy Box Story:
Imagine you're a magical toy that helps set up the perfect playroom for all the other toys.
Your job is to ask the toy owner where they want to put the special toy box. If they don't
answer, you use your magic to put it on their desk. Because magical toys know best, right?

Reality:
In the world of software, this plugin is responsible for setting up the SyftBox folder.
It interacts with the user to determine where to place the folder, and if the user doesn't
specify a location, it defaults to creating the folder on the desktop.

Let's dive into the magical world of folder creation and see how our setup wizard works! üöÄ
