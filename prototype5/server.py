Welcome to the SyftBox User Server: The Magical User Registry! üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüìú

Toy Box Story:
Imagine a magical scroll that keeps track of all the toy owners in the kingdom.
Anyone can add a new owner's name to the scroll, and it never forgets a name!

Reality:
This is a simple Flask server that maintains a list of users. It allows adding new users
and retrieving the list of all users.

Congratulations! You've set up the magical user registry. üéâ

This server will keep track of all the toy owners (users) in our SyftBox kingdom.
It's always ready to add new names or show the list of all known owners.

Next, let's create a client plugin that will use this magical scroll to create
toy boxes (folders) for each owner!
